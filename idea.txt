# IDEA
- if button click(set it to green) 
-> hash that date
-> save it as json date_hash:green
- every time you generate a calendar you first check if its hash is already in json and if so, set it to green
- use localstorage or sth



COLOR = WHITE
IF DAY IN DATABASE: 
COLOR = GREEN
GenerateCalendar(..color)

in ChangeColor:
IF CHANGE TO GREEN
  APPEND DATE TO DATABASE
IF CHANGE TO WHITE
  REMOVE DATE FROM DATABASE
